# Pre-Trained-Dog-Breed-Classifier
In this project, I have helped build an image classifier to identify dog breeds.
I have determined which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs".
Moreover, the I am also determining how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed. 
I have time how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem. With computational tasks, there is often a trade-off between accuracy and runtime. The more accurate an algorithm, the higher the likelihood that it will take more time to run and use more computational resources to run.
